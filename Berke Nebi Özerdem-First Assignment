# Database Management System And Spreadsheet

There are two ways that can be used to manage, store, retrieve and process data.
The first of these, the spreadsheet, is a computer software application that allows users to work in an interface environment similar to a calculation worksheet.
A database, on the other hand, is designed to easily organize, store, and retrieve large amounts of data.
Let's examine these two methods together.

# Spreadsheet:
* It has an easier and more understandable interface for beginners. It is easy to use. Therefore, it can be preferred.
* It does not offer data protection mechanisms to protect data from poorly trained users.
* It is very difficult to get data from advanced queries. This is a significant disadvantage according to the database.

# Database Management System

* A database contains a group of regular data for one or more users.
* It's better at storing data in one place and avoiding redundancy.
* Databases data are classified according to their content such as document-text, bibliographic and statistical.
* In general, databases offer better possibilities for concurrency.

What do you think is the main source of trouble in using a DBMS?
- We may experience problems with data security from time to time, although not very often.

Assume you have a team of Geomatics Engineers. Consider that employee A has very good skills in databases and prgramming and employee B does not possess these skills. Considering that you have the financial freedom and that you paying X TL to employee B; how much would you pay to employee A?
- I paid 40 percent more.
